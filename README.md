<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    YouTube is the world's biggest video platform service. However, when making a video, there are many steps to consider before publishing. These include creating an interesting thumbnail, storing videos, writing an intriguing video description, and sometimes even collaborating with others to speed up the video-editing process. YT Workflow is a web application aimed at helping solve these problems. It is a cloud service that stores videos, images, and text quickly while also allowing users to share their workflows with others. It organizes the entire process by ensuring all contributors to a video can see all media files for a given project at once in real time.

<h2>Programming Details</h2>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>
    The frontend was developed in JavaScript using the NextJs, a React framework. Moreover, the design and styling of the website was done using the modular version of Sass, a inheritance and function-based form of CSS. This allowed certain styles to impact only one aspect of a webpage, which makes its easy to manage.
</p>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>
    The backend was developed in Python using the Django library. The Django apps were responsible for recording any instances where users share a workflow, storing media files, creating user accounts, and creating workflows. A new Account model overrode the default User model to ensure the unique key identifier was the email of the user and to include information about the user's profile image. A SQLite3 database was used to store all the information and handle updating or deleting data.
</p>

<h2>Run the Code</h2>
<p>
    Run "npm init" in the client folder in a command line and "pipenv install" in the django_backend folder in its own command line. Then run "npm run dev" in the client command line to start a server to host the NextJs frontend. Run "pipenv shell" in the backend command line, then run "python manage.py runserver" to start a server to host the Django backend.
